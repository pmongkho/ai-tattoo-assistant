Core Concept Recap:
A lightweight service where clients start an AI-driven consultation for a tattoo idea. The system collects contact details and preferences so an artist can follow up manually. No local user accounts, profiles, job postings, or appointment management are stored.

🧩 Database Schema (PostgreSQL)
Only a single table is required:

📋 consultations
```sql
id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
client_name TEXT,
contact TEXT, -- email or phone supplied by the chat
artist_handle TEXT, -- identifier for the artist handling the request
style TEXT,
body_part TEXT,
size TEXT,
price_expectation TEXT,
availability TEXT,
status TEXT CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'approved', 'rejected')) DEFAULT 'pending',
submitted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
```

🗭 Frontend Pages (Angular)
